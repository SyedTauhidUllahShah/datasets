All
error   NN
messages   NNS
produced

so
that
they

be
appropriately
acted
upon
by
the
users   NNS
who
are
likely
to
see
them

Ideally
,
each

message   NN
will
be
accompanied
by
explanatory
text   NN
and
an
indication   NN
of
the
action   NN
s   NNS
which
the
user   NN
can
take
in
response   NN
to
the
error   NN

The
System   NNP
must
employ
a
single
set   NN
of
user   NN
interface   NN
rules   NNS
,
or
a
small
number   NN
of
sets   NNS
to
provide
a
familiar
and
common
look   NN
and
feel
for
the
application   NN
.

The
System   NNP
must
be
able
to
display
several
entities   NNS
cases   NNS
,
suspects
simultaneously
.

The
interfaces   NNS
must
be
made
customizable
or
user-configurable
to
the
extent   NN
possible
.
e.g.
,
the
displayed
columns   NNS
in
the
table   NN
,
move   NN
,
resize
,
modify
the
appearance   NN
.
Such
configurations   NNS
must
be
saved
in
the
user   NN
profile   NN
.

The
System   NNP
user   NN
interface   NN
must
be
suitable
for
users   NNS
with
special
needs   NNS
;
that
is
,
compatible
with
specialist   NN
software   NN
that
may
be
used
and
with
appropriate

The
System   NNP
must
provide
End   NN
User   NN
and
Administrator   NNP
functions   NNS
which
are
easy
to
use
and
intuitive
throughout

The
System   NNP
must
allow
persistent
defaults   NNS
for
data   NNS
entry   NN

,
values   NNS
same
as
previous
item   NN
,
values   NNS
derived
from
context   NN

reference   NN
,
user   NN
identifier   NN
.

Frequently-executed
System   NNP
transactions   NNS
must
be
designed
so
that
they
can
be
completed
with
a
small
number   NN
of
interactions   NNS
e.g.
mouse   NN
clicks   NNS
.

Where
the
System   NNP
employs
a
graphical
user   NN
interface   NN
,
it
must
allow
users   NNS
to
customise
it
.
Customisation   NN
should
include
,
but
need
not
be
limited
to
the
following
changes   NNS
:
menu   NN
contents   NNS
,
layout   NN
of
screens   NNS
,
use   NN
of
function   NN
keys   NNS
,
on-screen
colours   NNS
,
fonts   NNS
and
font   NN
sizes   NNS
.

The
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
should
be
designed
to
make
them
user-intuitive
.

The
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
of
the
system   NN
should
comply
with
.

ISO   NN

.

All
non-text
media   NNS
objects   NNS
,
such
as
graphical

,
should
be
provided
with
alternative
equivalent
textual
descriptions   NNS
and/or
with
equivalent
text-based
functionality   NN
.

Navigation   NNP
should
be
designed
to
help
users   NNS
understand
where
they
are
,
where
they
have
been
and
where
they
can
go
next
.
General   NNP
guidance   NN
on
achieving
self-descriptiveness   NN
is
given
in
ISO   NN
.

Each
presentation   NN
segment   NN
page   NN
or
window   NN
should
provide
the
user   NN
with
a
clear
and
sufficient
indication   NN
of
where
he
or
she
is
in
the
navigation   NN
structure   NN
and
of
the
current
segment   NN
position   NN
with
respect   NN
to
the
overall
structure   NN
.

Alternative
access   NN
paths   NNS
for
navigating
to
a
specific
unit   NN
of
content   NN
should
be
offered
to
support
different
navigation   NN
strategies   NNS
.

The
number   NN
of
navigation   NN
steps   NNS
needed
to
reach
a
certain
piece   NN
of
content   NN
should
be
minimized
as
long
as
different
mental
models   NNS
,
navigation   NN
strategies   NNS
and
tasks   NNS
of
the
user   NN
are
taken
into
account   NN
.

Splash   NNP
screens   NNS
should
be
avoided
unless
they
provide
useful
content   NN
or
feedback   NN
about
the
application   NN
state   NN
to
the
user   NN
.
If
a
splash   NN
screen   NN
is
used
,
a
navigation   NN
option   NN
to
skip
it
should
be
offered
.

Additional
windows   NNS
such
as
new
browser   NN
windows   NNS
or
pop-up
windows   NNS
should
only
be
opened
if
this
supports
the
user   NN
's
task   NN
.
Opening
new
windows   NNS
can
distract
,
confuse
or
impede
users   NNS
for
a
variety   NN
of
reasons   NNS
.
They
can
superimpose
the
primary
window   NN
,
hiding
relevant
information   NN
.
They
could
make
it
cognitively
more
difficult
to
understand
the
navigation   NN
structure   NN
with
negative
effects   NNS
on
both
usability   NN
and
accessibility   NN
.
They
also
require
additional
user   NN
actions   NNS
for
closing
unwanted
windows   NNS
.

Vertical
scrolling   NN
should
be
minimized
.
This
may
be
done
by
placing
important
information   NN
at
the
top
and
providing
links   NNS
to
information   NN
that
is
further
down
the
page   NN
.
Horizontal
scrolling   NN
should
be
avoided
wherever
possible
.

User   NN
interfaces   NNS
should
be
designed
to
allow
activation   NN
of
controls   NNS
by
a
variety   NN
of
input   NN
devices   NNS
.
The
ability   NN
to
choose
between
different
input   NN
devices   NNS
for
activating
controls   NNS
such
as
links   NNS
,
fields   NNS
and
buttons   NNS
is
important
both
for
users   NNS
who
prefer
a
certain
input   NN
mode   NN
,
mobile
users   NNS
and
users   NNS
with
disabilities   NNS
.
In
general
,
device   NN
independence   NN
can
be
achieved
if
the
functionality   NN
is
operable
via
a
keyboard   NN
.

User   NN
interfaces   NNS
should
be
designed
to
be
as
robust
as
possible
in
the
face   NN
of
changing
technology   NN
.
This
encompasses
being
able
to
present
content   NN
containing
newer
technologies   NNS
by
older
user   NN
agents   NNS
as
well
as
designing
content   NN
to
be
usable
with
future
technologies   NNS
.

Application   NN
pages   NNS
should
be
designed
and
implemented
so
that
there
are
acceptable
opening   NN
times   NNS
and
download
times   NNS
for
the
expected
range   NN
of
technical
contexts   NNS
of
use   NN
e.g.
bandwidth   NN
between
the
application   NN
and
the
user   NN
.
This
is
particularly
important
for
frequently
accessed
pages   NNS
or
pages   NNS
that
are
important
for
user   NN
navigation   NN
and
exploration   NN
,
such
as
the
home   NN
page   NN
.

Potential
user   NN
errors   NNS
as
well
as
the
effort   NN
needed
to
recover
from
errors   NNS
should
be
minimized
.

The
content   NN
of
error   NN
messages   NNS
shown
on
the
pages   NNS
or
special
error   NN
pages   NNS
should
clearly
state
the
reason   NN
why
the
error   NN
occurred
and
,
if
possible
,
actions   NNS
the
user   NN
can
take
to
resolve
the
error   NN
.
Users   NNS
expect
error   NN
messages   NNS
to
be
in
the
same
language   NN
as
the
user   NN
interface   NN
.

When
designing
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
for
use   NN
by
diverse
groups   NNS
,
input   NN
and
output   NN
of
information   NN
elements   NNS
such
as
currency   NN
,
units   NNS
of
measurement   NN
,
temperatures   NNS
,
date   NN
and
time   NN
,
phone   NN
numbers   NNS
,
address   NN
or
postal
codes   NNS
should
be
designed
so
that
they
are
usable
.

Text
should
be
able
to
be
resized
by
the
user   NN
,
using
functions   NNS
provided
by
the
user   NN
agent   NN
or
other
appropriate
means   NNS
i.e.
see
ISO   NN
.

The
quality   NN
of
textual
content   NN
with
respect   NN
to
spelling   NN
and
grammar   NN
should
be
sufficient
so
as
not
to
impede
readability   NN
.

The
reading   NN
and
understanding   NN
of
the
textual
content   NN
on
the
screen   NN
should
be
supported
by
suitable
means   NNS
,
including
the
use   NN
of
short
sentences   NNS
,
the
division   NN
of
the
text   NN
into
shorter
chunks   NNS
or
the
presentation   NN
of
content   NN
items   NNS
in
the
form   NN
of
bullet   NN
points   NNS
.

Fast
skimming   NN
of
text   NN
should
be
supported
by
the
provision   NN
of
clear
links   NNS
,
bulleted
lists   NNS
,
highlighted
keywords   NNS
,
logical
headings   NNS
,
and
short
phrases   NNS
and
sentences   NNS
.

Text
presented
on
the
pages   NNS
should
be
readable
taking
into
account   NN
the
expected
display   NN
characteristics   NNS
and
spatial
arrangement   NN
.
ISO   NN
shall
be
consulted
for
screen   NN
text   NN
legibility   NN
requirements   NNS
.

Within-page
links   NNS
should
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
other
links   NNS
that
lead
to
a
different
page   NN
.
EX   NN
.
Within-page
links   NNS
are
shown
with
dashed
rather
than
solid
underlines   NNS
.

Text
pages   NNS
containing
large
proportions   NNS
of
links   NNS
should
be
formatted
so
that
the
presence   NN
of
links   NNS
does
not
impede
the
readability   NN
of
the
text   NN
.

Navigation   NNP
links   NNS
--
particularly
links   NNS
representing
the
main
navigation   NN
structure   NN
--
should
be
labelled
with
terms   NNS
that
are
familiar
to
the
user   NN
,
based
on
his/her   NN
general
knowledge   NN
,
prior
experience   NN
in
the
application   NN
domain   NN
or
experience   NN
of
using
other
systems   NNS
.

The
target   NN
or
purpose   NN
of
a
link   NN
should
be
directly
indicated
by
its
label   NN
,
avoiding
generic
labels   NNS
such
as
``
go
''
or
``
click
here
''
except
where
the
purpose   NN
of
the
link   NN
is
clear
from
its
context   NN
on
the
page   NN
or
the
labels   NNS
have
commonly
understood
semantics   NNS
in
the
particular
application   NN
domain   NN
.
Using
appropriate
terminology   NN
specific
to
the
user   NN
's
tasks   NNS
and
information   NN
needs   NNS
is
important
for
making
the
content   NN
easy
to
understand
.

Links   NNP
that
open
new
browser   NN
windows   NNS
or
pop-up
windows   NNS
should
be
clearly
marked
.

Navigation   NNP
links   NNS
should
be
clearly
distinguishable
from
controls   NNS
activating
some
action   NN
.
Typical
action   NN
types   NNS
in
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
include
manipulating
application   NN
data   NNS
,
performing
searches   NNS
,
communication   NN
actions   NNS
,
such
as
opening
a
new
e-mail   NN
window   NN
or
starting
a
chat   NN
function   NN
,
and
presentation-related
actions   NNS
,
such
as
sorting
a
list   NN
of
search   NN
results   NNS
.

If
a
document   NN
is
either
too
long
,
dispersed
over
several
pages   NNS
or
in
a
specific
layout   NN
that
is
not
suitable
for
online
reading   NN
,
a
printer-friendly
version   NN
of
the
document   NN
should
be
provided
that
prints
the
content   NN
in
a
form   NN
acceptable
to
the
user   NN
e.g.
in
the
expected
layout   NN
,
paper   NN
format   NN

or
orientation   NN
.

space   NN
''
''
on
a
page   NN
i.e.
space   NN
filled

should
be
used
in
such
a
way   NN
that
it
does
not
impair
the
visual
skimming   NN
of
the

.
While
white

is
an
important
means   NNS
of
visually
organizing
the
different
content   NN
elements   NNS
on
a
page   NN
,
if
the
distance   NN
between
the

of
information   NN
displayed
becomes
too
large
,
rapid
skimming   NN
of
the
page   NN
can
be
impeded
.
''

The
length   NN
of
a
page   NN
should
be
selected
so
as
to
support
the
primary
purpose   NN
and
use   NN
of
the
page   NN
.
Short
pages   NNS
are
generally
more
appropriate
for
homepages   NNS
,
navigation   NN
pages   NNS
,
or
overview   NN
pages   NNS
that
need
to
be
read
quickly
.
Longer
pages   NNS
can
be
more
appropriate
when
users   NNS
want
to
read
the
content   NN
without
interruptions   NNS
or
when
the
page   NN
needs
to
match
a
paper   NN
counterpart   NN

Colour   NNP
should
be
used
with
care   NN
,
taking
into
account   NN
human
capabilities   NNS
and
restrictions   NNS
in
perceiving
colour   NN
,
and
not
as
the
only
means   NNS
of
conveying
information   NN

Color   NN
should
never

Some
users   NNS
may
have
difficulties   NNS
in
perceiving
certain
colors   NNS
or
color   NN
combinations   NNS
color-blindness   NN
.

If
frames   NNS
are
used
,
care   NN
should
be
taken
to
avoid
possible

other
.

If
frames   NNS
are
used
,
an
alternative
way   NN
of
presenting
relevant
information   NN
without
frames   NNS
should
be
provided
.
Providing
alternative
text-only
pages   NNS
:
When
style   NN
sheets   NNS
and/or
frames   NNS
are
turned
off
it
should
be
possible
for
the
user   NN
to
read
and
understand
the
page   NN
;
alternatively
,
the
user   NN
should
be
provided
with
an
equivalent
alternative
text-only
page   NN
.

Pages   NNP
should
be
designed
using
consistent
layout   NN
schemes   NNS
,
supporting
the
user   NN
in
finding
similar
information   NN
at
the
same
position   NN
on
different
pages   NNS
.
Overall
layout   NN
schemes   NNS
apply
to
all
pages   NNS
and
are
preferable
when
all
pages   NNS
have
a
similar
structure   NN
.
Frequently
,
however
,
different
pages   NNS
have
different
purposes   NNS
and
types   NNS
of
content   NN
.
In
such
cases   NNS
,
pages   NNS
can
usually
be
grouped
in
different
categories   NNS
,
using
layout   NN
scheme   NN
for
each
category   NN
consistently
.

Page   NNP
titles   NNS
should
be
placed
in
a
consistent
location   NN
on
the
different
pages   NNS
.

When
designing
application   NN
pages   NNS
,
the
general
principles   NNS
of
human
perception   NN
should
be
taken
into
account   NN
.
The
International   NNP
Standards   NNPS
mentioned
below
shall
be
consulted
for
guidance   NN
.
Practical   NNP
guidelines   NNS
for
presenting
information   NN
to
the
user   NN
are
to
be
found
in
9241-12
.
Guidance   NN
on
selecting   NN
and
using
different
forms   NNS
of
interaction   NN
techniques   NNS
is
to
be
found
in
to
.
gives
guidance   NN
about
menus   NNS
,
about
command   NN
dialogues   NNS
,
about
direct
manipulation   NN
and
about
forms   NNS
.
In
addition   NN
,
when
designing
multimedia   NNS
information   NN
presentations   NNS
,
the
design   NN
principles   NNS
and
recommendations   NNS
described
in
to
should
be
taken
into
account   NN
.
Appropriate
content   NN
presentation   NN
also
plays
a
key
role   NN
in
accessibility   NN
.

Each
page   NN
should
contain
a
link   NN
leading
to
the
home   NN
page   NN
of
the
application   NN
or
to
a
landmark   NN
page   NN
that
is
easy
to
recognize
for
the
user   NN
.

A
separate
navigation   NN
overview   NN
such
as
a
site   NN
map   NN
should
be
provided
for
application   NN
showing
the
structure   NN
of
the
site   NN
in
an
overview   NN
form   NN
.

If
navigation   NN
components   NNS
or
overviews   NNS
are
shown
in
conjunction   NN
with
associated
content   NN
,
consistency   NN
between
the
navigation   NN
component   NN
and
the
content   NN
shown
should
be
maintained
by
indicating
in
the
navigation   NN
component   NN
e.g.
highlighting
the
topic   NN
currently
visible
in
the
content
area   NN
.

Navigation   NNP
components   NNS
should
be
placed
consistently
on
the
pages   NNS
or
in
the
framesets   NNS
in
the
pages   NNS
of
the
application   NN
.

Adapting
the
content   NN
and
the
navigation   NN
of
a
user   NN
interface   NN
to
individual
users   NNS
or
user   NN
groups   NNS
can
be
a
useful
mechanism   NN
for
providing
information   NN
that
is
of
interest   NN
to
the
users   NNS
and
for
making
access   NN
to
relevant
information   NN
more
efficient
.
User   NN
adaptation   NN
can
also
be
important
for
making
the
user   NN
interface   NN
more
accessible
.
Different
approaches   NNS
can
be
used
for
achieving
these
goals   NNS
,
like
providing
users   NNS
with
means   NNS
for
customizing
the
user   NN
interface   NN
to
their
personal
needs   NNS
i.e.
individualization   NN
designing
content   NN
and
navigation   NN
differently
for
varying
user   NN
groups   NNS
or
roles   NNS
i.e.
such
as
employees   NNS
of
different
levels   NNS
,
citizens   NNS
etc
,
monitoring
the
user   NN
's
behaviour   NN
and
adapting
to
the
user   NN
's
goals   NNS
that
are
inferred
from
the
behaviour   NN
observed
,
recommending
information   NN
that
is
potentially
more
relevant
or
interesting
to
the
specific
user   NN
,
based
on
the
behaviour   NN
of
all
users   NNS
or
a
user   NN
group   NN
.

When
providing
different
access   NN
paths   NNS
or
navigation   NN
structures   NNS
for
different
user   NN
groups   NNS
,
the
tasks   NNS
and
information   NN
needs   NNS
of
these
user   NN
groups   NNS
should
be
taken
into
consideration   NN
.

It
should
be
made
evident
to
the
user   NN
when
individualization   NN
and/or
adaptation   NN
are
used
.

If
predefined
user   NN
profiles   NNS
or
user-specified
profiles   NNS
are
used
for
individualizing
or
adapting
content   NN
,
the
profile   NN
currently
used
should
be
made
evident
.
If
profiles   NNS
are
used
,
it
is
important
to
provide
users   NNS
with
information   NN
about
this
concept   NN
and
its
implications   NNS
.

If
user-specified
profiles   NNS
are
used
,
users   NNS
should
be
able
to
see
,
modify
and
delete
that
profile   NN
on
demand   NN
.

The
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
of
the
system   NN
should
follow
the
guidelines   NNS
specified
under

The
System   NNP
must
be
available
to
users   NNS
:
from

on
<
all
weekdays/xxx   NN
days   NNS
per

.

The
planned
downtime   NN
for
the
System   NNP
must
not
exceed
<xx>   NN
hours   NNS
per
<rolling three month period>   NN
.

The
System   NNP
is
considered
to
be
down
if
any
user   NN
is
unable
to
perform
any
normal
System   NN
function   NN
and
if
this
failure   NN
is
attributed
to
any
component   NN
of
the
System   NNP
other
than
the
workstation   NN
.

Unplanned
downtime   NN
for
the
System   NNP
must
not
exceed
<
hours/minutes   NNS
>
per
<rolling three month period>   NN
.

The
number   NN
of
incidents   NNS
of
unplanned
downtime   NN
for
the
System   NNP
must
not
exceed
<x>   NN
per
<rolling three month period>   NN
.

In
the
event   NN
of
any
software   NN
or
hardware   NN
failure   NN
,
it
must
be
possible
to
restore
the
System   NN
with
inline   NN
synchronization   NN
within
within
<xx>   NN
hours   NNS
.

The
System   NNP
must
provide
adequate
response   NN
times   NNS
for
commonly
performed
functions   NNS
under
both
standard
and
peak
conditions   NNS
.

The
System   NNP
must
be
able
to
perform
a
simple
search   NN
within
5-fast
and
a
advanced

criteria   NNS
within
10-fast
regardless
of
the
storage   NN
capacity   NN
or
number   NN
of
cases   NNS
within
the
system   NN
.
In
this
context   NN
,
performing
a
search   NN
means
returning
a
result   NN
list   NN
.
It
does
not
include
retrieving
the
records   NNS
themselves
.

The
System   NNP
must
be
able
to
retrieve
and
display
within
5-fast
the
case   NN
which
has
been
accessed
within
the
previous
2
months   NNS
,
regardless
of
storage   NN
capacity   NN
or
number   NN
of
cases   NNS
within
the
system   NN
.
This
requirement   NN
is
intended
to
allow
for
rapid
retrieval   NN
of
frequently-used
cases   NNS
,
on
the
understanding   NN
that
frequency   NN
of
use   NN
is
typically
correlated
with
recent
use   NN
.

The
System   NNP
must
be
able
to
retrieve
and
display
fast
the

which
has
not
been
accessed
within
the
previous
2
months   NNS
,
regardless
of
storage   NN
capacity   NN
or
number   NN
of
cases   NNS
within
the
system   NN
.
This
requirement   NN
is
intended
to
allow
for
cases   NNS
where
cases   NNS
used
infrequently
are
stored
on
slower
media   NNS
than
more
active
records   NNS
.

The
System   NNP
be
scaleable
and
must
not
have
any

which
would
preclude
use   NN
in
small

stations   NNS
,
with
varying

because
many

The
Application   NN

It
is
important
to
design
system   NN
to
facilitated
future
evolution   NN
and
facilitate
maintenance   NN
operations   NNS

Every
command   NN
must
be
accepted/rejected
within
2
sec   NN
and
before
the
correspond
-
ing   NN
action   NN
occurs
.
This
is
different
than
the
ACK/NAK   NN
response   NN
of
the
communications   NNS
protocol   NN
-
here
,
the
target   NN
system   NN
must
have
examined
the
command   NN
and
verified
its
validity   NN
.

Status   NN
display   NN
update
must
be
within
4
sec   NN
at
the
local

,
such
as

the
Requirements   NNS
for
Remote   NNP
Operations   NNP
section   NN

Requests   NNS
of

information   NN
must
be
answered
within
5
sec   NN
and
be
possible
within
maintenance   NN
level   NN
operation   NN
.

All
software   NN
bugs   NNS
should
be
logged
and
then
fixed
as
soon
as
possible
after
detection   NN
.
The
goal   NN
is
to
have
restart
conditions   NNS
occur
only
on
hardware   NN
failure   NN
.

Fault   NNP
recovery   NN
,
exception   NN
handling   NN
,
fail-safe
checks   NNS
,
etc.
should
be
used
to
improve
reliability   NN
.

Should
a
subsystem   NN
fail
e.g.
detector
,
instrument   NN
predefined
procedures   NNS
must
exist
to
redefine
the
environment   NN
in
such
a
way   NN
that
operation   NN
can
restart

In
case   NN
of
computer   NN
hardware   NN
failure   NN
concerning
the

station   NN
equipment   NN
,
it
shall
be
possible
to
transfer
control   NN
from
user   NN
station   NN
to
another
via
a
simple
software   NN
reconfiguration   NN
procedure   NN
.

In
the
case   NN
of
failure   NN
,
no
transfer   NN
of
control   NN
to
another
will
be
possible
,
due
to
the
local
connections   NNS
and
interfaces   NNS
to
the
control   NN
electronics   NNS
.
In
this
case   NN
there
shall
be
a
procedure   NN
to
replace
faulty
cards   NNS
and/or
assemblies   NNS
.
If
it
is
possible
to
observe
with
that
particular
in
a
failed
state   NN
in
general
,
this
is
limited
to
s   NNS
that
are
associated
with
individual
scientific
instruments   NNS
then
it
must
be
possible
to
reconfigure   NN
the
system   NN
to
do
so
.

The
GSR   NNP
sets
as
a
requirement   NN
little
and
a
goal   NN
little
for
total
system   NN
mechanical
,
electrical
,
and
software   NN
downtime   NN
due
to
failures   NNS
-
this
translates
to
a
maximum   NN
of
fast
per
or
per
month   NN
of
downtime   NN
.
This
within
turn   NN
sets
quite
stringent
requirements   NNS
on
both
MTBF   NN
and
for
the
software   NN
and
controls   NNS
.

To
guarantee
maximum
availability   NN
of
the
control   NN
system   NN
,
retry
procedures   NNS
must
be
embodied
in
the
software   NN
in
case   NN
of
error   NN
or
failure   NN
e.g.
time-out   NN
,
hardware   NN
failure   NN
to
achieve
recovery   NN
on-line
whenever
possible
.

Maintenance   NN

of
upgrading
the
system   NN
to
add
capabilities   NNS

Areas   NNS
where
upgrades   NNS
are
anticipated
should
be
identified
with
an
estimate   NN
of
the
required
effort   NN
and
resources   NNS
.

A
system   NN
that
is
operating
in
Engineering/Maintenance   NNP
mode   NN
must
ignore
directives   NNS
from
other
systems   NNS
,
though
status   NN
information   NN
should
still
be
provided
for
use   NN
by
other
systems   NNS
.

There
should
be
security   NN
preventing
the
intrusion   NN
into
the

by
unauthorized

This
depends
on
the

The

The

should
be
fast
enough
to
avoid
interrupting
the

be
executed
without

in
a
machine   NN
that
fulfills
the
requirements   NNS
of
the
Java   NNP
runtime   NN
environment   NN

The
basic
artificial
intelligence   NN
must
operate
fast
enough
.
The
next
move   NN
should
be
calculated
fast
.

GUIs   NNS
associated
with
the
Framework   NNP
SHOULD
be
designed
such
that
an
user   NN
with
basic
understanding   NN
of
the
Windows   NNP
2000/XP   NN
operating   NN
systems   NNS
would
instinctively
be
able
to
interact
with
them
.
Therefore
,
most
GUIs   NNS
MAY   NNP
need
to
closely
mimic
popular
Windows   NNP
applications   NNS
.

At
this
stage   NN
of
the
development   NN
,
the
Framework   NNP
MAY   NNP
only
operate
in
single
user   NN
mode   NN
,
with
no
networking   NN
capabilities   NNS
.

The
SHOULD
NOT
utilize
more
than
megabytes   NNS
of
RAM   NNP
.

The
Framework   NNP
MUST   NNP
guard   NN
against
malicious
scripts   NNS
on
remote
websites   NNS
from
accessing
its
information   NN
.

The
Framework   NNP
MUST   NNP
guard   NN
against
unintended
corruption   NN
of
information   NN
by
the
user   NN
himself
.

The
data   NNS
system   NN
shall
show
no
visible
deterioration   NN
within
response   NN
time   NN
as
the
number   NN
of
persons   NNS
increases   NNS
.
Response   NN
times   NNS
seen
by
end   NN
users   NNS
for
querying
metadata   NN
should
be
on
the
order   NN
of
a
few
fast
or
less
.
Response   NN
times   NNS
seen
by
end   NN
users   NNS
for
retrieving
the
actual
images   NNS
may
take
much
longer
,
anywhere
from
a
few
fast
to
several
hours   NNS
.
If
the
user   NN
requests   NNS
a
large
image   NN
with
a
short
response   NN
time   NN
,
it
is
acceptable
for
the
data   NNS
system   NN
to
advise
the
user   NN
that
the
target   NN
response   NN
time   NN
can
not
be
met
.
In
that
case   NN
,
the
person   NN
would
be
referred
to
an
alternate
method   NN
of
getting
the
data   NNS
.

The
data   NNS
system   NN
shall
load
as
quickly
as
comparable
productivity   NN
tools   NNS
on
whatever
environment   NN
it
is
running

STEWARDS   NNS
will
follow
industry   NN
best
practices   NNS
for
authentication   NN
,
using
single-sign-on
systems   NNS
like
Active
Directory   NNP
to
perform
authentication   NN
.
Authentication   NN
addresses   NNS
security   NN
requirements   NNS
to
ensure
those
using
system   NN
are
who
they
say
they
are
.
This
is
of
greatest
concern   NN
when
data   NNS
are
being
changed
or
updated
.
This
is
primarily
done
through
userids   NNS
and
passwords   NNS
.

Confidentiality   NN
security   NN
requirements   NNS
describe
the
need   NN
to
protect
the
data   NNS
appropriately
.
STEWARDS   NNS
will
use
the
user   NN
classes   NNS
described
in
section   NN
above
to
define
boundaries   NNS
of
information   NN
sharing
to
ensure
confidentiality   NN
as
appropriate
.
Any
data   NNS
that
should
be
viewed
by
a
restricted
audience   NN
must
be
protected
with
appropriate
security   NN
features   NNS
.

The
integrity   NN
of
STEWARDS   NNPS
data   NNS
will
be
critical
to
its
success   NN
as
a
product   NN
.
Scientific   NNP
research   NN
and
publications   NNS
will
be
based
on
the
data   NNS
obtained
through
the
system   NN
.
Therefore
,
extensive
data   NNS
validation   NN
and
review   NN
will
be
performed
both
before
data   NNS
are
uploaded
to
the
system   NN
and
as
part   NN
of
the
upload   NN
process   NN
.
The
system   NN
will
need
policy   NN
and
procedures   NNS
protecting
the
data   NNS
from
intentional
or
unintentional
modifications   NNS
,
and
to
ensure
accurate
data   NNS
are
made
available
.

The
fourth
consideration   NN
for
security   NN
requirements   NNS
is
availability   NN
.
The
system   NN
must
be
available
to
the
intended
audience   NN
alltimess   NN
per
day   NN
,
7
days   NNS
a
week   NN
with
,
most
availability   NN
and
a
tolerance   NN
of
-
little
not
less
than
most
of
working
hours   NNS
within
any
week   NN
.
For
this
system   NN
,
availability   NN
will
be
concerned
with
the
reliability   NN
of
the
software   NN
and
network   NN
components   NNS
.
Intentional
``
denial   NN
of
service   NN
attacks   NNS
''
is
not
foreseen
as
a
significant
concern   NN
.

The
system   NN
shall
provide
a
uniform
look   NN
and
feel
between
all
the
web   NN
pages   NNS

provide
a
simple
,
responsive
interface   NN
.

The
system   NN
should
support

1000
concurrent
users   NNS
.

The
system   NN
must

their
operations   NNS
.
The
system   NN
must
accomplish
most
for
transactions   NNS
within
less

This
is
due
to
the
nature   NN
of
data   NNS
,
which
is
only
text   NN
information   NN
that
does
not
usually
exceed
KB   NN
per

The
system   NN
has
to
be
available
all
of
the
time   NN

Once
there
is
a
fatal
error   NN

only
roles   NNS
for
coordinators   NNS
,
suppliers   NNS
and
customers   NNS
only
that
make
our
system   NN
secure
access   NN
online   NN
and
these
authentications   NNS
will
prevent
and
illegal
access   NN
.

The
system   NN
is
designed
in
modules   NNS
where
errors   NNS
can
be
detected
and
fixed
easily
.
This
makes
it
easier
to
install
updates   NNS
and
new

available
.
The
availability   NN
of
Wilma   NNP
is
an
issue   NN
that
should
be
handled
by
the
customer   NN
.

In
case   NN
of
a
corrupted
database   NN
the
Administrator   NNP
should
replace
the
database   NN
by
the
last
available
database   NN
backup   NN
.
In
case   NN
of
another
failure   NN
hardware   NN
or
software   NN
related
the
problem   NN
should
be
first
solved
and
afterwards
the
PMS   NN
should
be
reinitialized
.
During
this
downtime   NN
the
PMS   NN
should
give
an
error   NN
to
the
visitors   NNS
,
stating
that
the
PMS   NNP
is
temporarily
down
.

Every
user   NN
account   NN
is
protected
with
a
personal

Nobody   NN
except
the
specific
user   NN
should
be
able
to
log
into
that
account   NN
and
change   NN
personal
information   NN
.

The
password   NN
of
the
user   NN
should
be
encrypted
when
submitted
from
user   NN
to
server   NN
.
It
should
also
be
saved
in
an
encrypted
way   NN
in
the
database   NN
and
no-one   NN
except
the
PMS   NN
should
be
able
to
access   NN
these
passwords   NNS
.

Direct

is
only
allowed
for
Administrator   NNP
s   NNS
using
the
CLI   NN
.

The

levels   NNS
see
section   NN
should
always
be
respected
with
regard   NN
to
editing   NN
,
deleting
and
uploading
publications   NNS
and
their
bibliographical
details   NNS
.

The
database   NN
of
the
PMS   NN
should
be
maintained
by
the
Administrator   NNP
s   NNS
.

The
PMS   NN
with
concern   NN
to
the
user   NN
levels   NNS
,
special
privileges   NNS
,
...
should
be
maintained
by
the
Administrators   NNPS
on
a
global
level   NN
.

On
the
Departmental
level   NN
the
Moderator   NNP
s   NNS
will
be
able
to
maintain
the
PMS   NN
this
way   NN
.

The

screen   NN
user   NN
interfaces   NNS
,
and
take
advantage   NN
of
that
technology   NN
to
be
as
fast

efficient
,
intuitive
,
and
flexible
as
possible
while
also
minimizing
the
potential   NN
for
errors   NNS
and
duplications   NNS
.
It
should
minimize
the
use   NN
of
keyboard   NN
and
mouse   NN
when
processing
acquisitions   NNS
,
and
should
allow
acquisitions   NNS
to
be
completed
with
few

is
granted
or
denied
based
on
the

user   NN
,
as
detailed
in
the
preceding
use-case
requirements   NNS
.
The

about
various
sensitive
inventory   NN
management   NN
operations   NNS
such
as
deleting

the
price   NN
of
items   NNS
.

The
functionality   NN
provided
by
the
Inventory   NNP
Management   NNP
System   NNP
will
be
critical
to
the
normal
operation   NN
of
the

.
As
such
,
the
system   NN
should
perform
with
consistently
and
predictably
low
