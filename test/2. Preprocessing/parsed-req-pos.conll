The
System   NNP
design   NN
assumes
that
user   NN
input   NN
is
malicious

Data   NNS
is
validated
for
type   NN
,

.

Data   NNS
validation   NN
is
consistent
across
the
System   NNP
.

System   NNP
avoids
un-trusted
input   NN
of
file   NN
name   NN
and
file   NN
paths   NNS
.

System   NNP
does
not
accept
file   NN
names   NNS
or
file   NN
paths   NNS
from
calling
functions   NNS
.

Security   NN
decisions   NNS
are
not
made
based
on
user-supplied
file   NN
names   NNS
and
paths   NNS

System   NNP
does
not
use
parent   NN
paths   NNS
when
data   NNS
within
the
System   NNP
is
being
accessed
.

Attempts   NNS
to
access   NN
resources   NNS
using
parent   NN
paths   NNS

code   NN
,
such
as
